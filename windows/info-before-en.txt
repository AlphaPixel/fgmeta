FlightGear LTS
==============

Contains FlightGear stable source code from source code repository ('release' branch). 
This is the FlightGear installer for Long Term Support (LTS) version. It contains
the most stable and well tested FlightGear source code. Have fun using it !

Latest features ?
-----------------

Please take a look at the FlightGear unstable installer, but beware, it can contains
new, not well tested code. If you want to have solid and stable flight experience
stick with this FlightGear LTS version.


I have found a bug !
--------------------

If you find serious bugs, instability, performance degradation:

- look at the FlightGear Tickets page (on the SourceForge project page)
- ask on the FlightGear forum (explicitly say that you're using LTS version)
- look at the flightgear-devel mailing list

There is a probability, that developers are working on the solution it right now !
