A set of trivial python scripts to generate World Scener 3.0 (ws30) scenery
features from openstreetmap data, using the overpass API to retrieve data at
runtime.

These scripts are very simplistic and don't attempt to be particularly efficient
in their use of the API.  The should be improved before use on the entire world, 
as they will (and do) result in being blocked from the overpass API if used on 
and unreasonably large area.
